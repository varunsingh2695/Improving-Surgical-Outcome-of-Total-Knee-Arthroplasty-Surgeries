##################################################

Our study was done in collaboration with Bonutti Technologies, a healthcare firm and clinic and leading in creation of innovative medical devices.

The Study_Code.R file contains all the R code written to extract, clean, tranform the data. The dataset is not available to upload, since it contains PHI/PII (personal healthcare and identifiable data) 
and proprietary data. 

The other two files are the final presentation and the paper.
